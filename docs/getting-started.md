# Getting Started with Beecork

Beecork makes Claude Code always-on and reachable from your phone via Telegram, WhatsApp, or Discord.

- A Telegram account (for the bot)

## Setup

### 1. Install Beecork

```bash
npm install -g beecork-pipe
```

### 2. Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a display name (e.g., "My Beecork")
4. Choose a username ending in `bot` (e.g., `mybeecork_bot`)
5. Copy the API token BotFather gives you

### 3. Find Your Telegram User ID

1. Search for **@userinfobot** on Telegram
2. Send it any message
3. It will reply with your user ID (a number like `123456789`)

### 4. Run Setup

beecork-pipe setup
```

Follow the prompts to enter your bot token and user ID.

### 5. Start the Daemon

## Useful Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `beecork-pipe status` | Check if daemon is running |
| `beecork-pipe tabs` | List active tabs |
| `beecork-pipe logs` | View daemon logs |
| `beecork-pipe doctor` | Run diagnostics |

## Organizing Work with Tabs

Use `/tab name message` in Telegram to route work to named tabs:

- `/tab deploy push the latest changes` — works in a "deploy" tab
- `/tab research find info about X` — works in a "research" tab
- `/tabs` — see all active tabs
- `/stop deploy` — stop the deploy tab

Each tab has its own Claude Code session, working directory, and memory.
