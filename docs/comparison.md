| System service install | Yes (launchd/systemd) | Manual setup | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Works while you sleep | Yes | Yes | Only if Mac stays on | Yes | Yes |

**Verdict**: Beecork and OpenClaw are true daemons. Dispatch requires your Mac to be awake. Cloud products (Perplexity, Manus) are always on but you don't control the infrastructure.

### Multi-Agent / Multi-Folder

| Feature | Beecork | OpenClaw | Claude Dispatch | Perplexity Computer | Manus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Multiple concurrent agents | Yes (tabs) | Yes (multi-agent) | Single session | Yes (sub-agents) | Yes (sub-agents) |
| Folder-aware routing | Yes (auto-discovery) | No (manual config) | No | No | No |
| Agent delegation | Yes (depth-limited) | Yes (orchestrator) | No | Yes (model-specific) | Yes (planner/executor) |
| Per-agent working directory | Yes | Yes | Single workspace | Sandboxed | Sandboxed |

**Verdict**: Beecork's folder-aware routing is unique — it auto-discovers your git repos and routes messages to the right tab. OpenClaw has the most flexible multi-agent architecture.

### Memory & Context

| Feature | Beecork | OpenClaw | Claude Dispatch | Perplexity Computer | Manus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Long-term memory | Yes (3-layer) | Yes (markdown files) | Yes (cross-session) | Via Personal Computer | File-based in sandbox |
| Auto-extraction | Yes | Yes | Unclear | No | No |
| Memory search | Yes (full-text) | Yes (BM25 + vector) | No API | No | No |
| Context compaction | Yes (auto at 90%) | Yes (summarize + flush) | 1M context window | Model-dependent | Context engineering |
| Knowledge layers | Global + folder + tab | Per-agent files | N/A | N/A | N/A |

**Verdict**: Beecork and OpenClaw both have sophisticated memory systems. OpenClaw's hybrid BM25+vector search is more advanced. Dispatch benefits from Claude's native 1M context window. Manus's context engineering approach is well-documented and clever.

### Scheduling & Automation

| Feature | Beecork | OpenClaw | Claude Dispatch | Perplexity Computer | Manus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scheduled tasks | Yes (cron/interval/one-time) | Yes (heartbeat daemon) | Yes (daily/weekly/hourly) | No | Yes (daily/weekly/monthly) |
| Watchers (condition-based) | Yes (check + condition + action) | No | No | No | No |
| Auto-triggered actions | Yes (notify/fix/delegate) | Yes (agent triggers) | Yes (via connectors) | No | No |

**Verdict**: Beecork's watcher system is unique — it periodically runs a check command, evaluates a condition, and takes action. No other tool has this. Dispatch's scheduled tasks are simpler but well-integrated.

### Computer Use

| Feature | Beecork | OpenClaw | Claude Dispatch | Perplexity Computer | Manus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mouse/keyboard control | Yes (via Claude Code) | Yes (browser automation) | Yes (native) | Yes (sandboxed) | Yes ("My Computer") |
| Local app control | Yes | Limited | Yes | Personal Computer only | Yes (desktop app) |
| Screen reading | Yes | No | Yes | Sandboxed browser | Yes |
| Full Claude Computer Use | Paid plans | N/A | Included | N/A | N/A |

**Verdict**: Dispatch and Manus have the most polished computer use. Beecork supports Claude Computer Use (mouse, keyboard, screen control) via the `beecork-pipe computer-use` command. Perplexity runs in isolated sandboxes.

### Media Generation

| Feature | Beecork | OpenClaw | Claude Dispatch | Perplexity Computer | Manus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Image generation | Yes (DALL-E, Recraft, Nano Banana) | Via skills | Via connectors | Yes (Nano Banana) | Via sandbox |
| Video generation | Yes (Runway, Veo, Kling) | No | No | Yes (Veo 3.1) | No |
| Music/Audio generation | Yes (ElevenLabs, Lyria) | No | No | No | No |
| Voice (STT/TTS) | Yes (Whisper + OpenAI/ElevenLabs) | No | No | No | No |

**Verdict**: Beecork has the most comprehensive built-in media generation with 10+ providers. Most competitors require external integrations or don't support it.

### AI Model / CLI Support

| Feature | Beecork | OpenClaw | Claude Dispatch | Perplexity Computer | Manus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Yes (primary) | No | N/A | No | No |
| Any OpenAI-compatible | No | Yes | No | No | No |
| Multi-model orchestration | No | No | No | Yes (19 models) | Yes |

**Verdict**: Beecork wraps Claude Code — giving you full tool use, MCP, and computer use capabilities from your messaging channels. The architecture is designed to support additional coding CLIs (Codex, Gemini CLI) as they mature — see [Roadmap](#roadmap). OpenClaw supports any OpenAI-compatible model. Perplexity orchestrates 19 models but at $200/mo.

### Pricing & Cost

| | Beecork | OpenClaw | Claude Dispatch | Perplexity Computer | Manus |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pricing model** | **Your Claude subscription** | BYO API keys | Bundled in Claude plan | Credit-based | Credit-based |
| **Free tier** | **Yes (self-hosted)** | Yes (self-hosted) | No | No | Yes (limited) |
| **API keys required?** | **No\*** | Yes (you manage keys) | No (bundled) | No (bundled) | No (bundled) |
| **Token/usage costs?** | **No — runs on your Claude plan** | Yes (you pay per token) | Bundled (opaque) | Credits (opaque) | Credits (expire monthly) |
| **Cost predictability** | **Fixed monthly price** | Unpredictable (varies by usage) | Fixed monthly | Credit burn varies | Credit burn varies |
| **Cost transparency** | **Full — you know exactly what you pay** | You see API bills but costs vary | Opaque (bundled) | Opaque (credit-based) | Opaque (credit-based) |

\* Core features (messaging, tabs, scheduling, memory, MCP tools) work entirely on your Claude Pro/Max subscription — no API keys, no token costs. Optional add-ons like media generation and voice use third-party API keys.

**Beecork's pricing advantage**: Beecork runs on your existing Claude subscription instead of building a separate API layer. No API keys to manage for core functionality, no token costs, no surprise bills. OpenClaw is free software but you pay unpredictable API costs. Perplexity and Manus use credit systems where a single complex task can burn hundreds of credits with no upfront estimate.

### Developer Experience

## Honest Weaknesses

We believe in transparency. Here's where Beecork falls short today:

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| **Fewer channels than OpenClaw** | 5 channels vs 20+. Slack, Signal, iMessage coming soon but not yet available. |
| **No mobile/desktop app yet** | Coming soon. Today you interact via messaging apps, CLI, or web dashboard. |
| **Single CLI today** | Built on Claude Code. Support for additional coding CLIs (Codex, Gemini CLI) is on the roadmap as they mature. No 19-model approach like Perplexity. |
| **Requires some technical setup** | Needs Node.js and npm. The setup wizard handles most configuration. |
| **Basic dashboard** | The web UI is functional but minimal compared to Manus or Perplexity's polished interfaces. |
| **Smaller community** | Growing project without OpenClaw's 335K+-star ecosystem yet. |

## Roadmap

Planned additions (no timeline commitment):

- **Additional coding CLIs** — Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and other agentic CLIs as they mature. The architecture wraps CLI subprocesses, making this a natural extension.
- **More channels** — Slack, Signal, iMessage, mobile app, desktop app
- **Multi-model orchestration** — Route to the best CLI/model for each task
